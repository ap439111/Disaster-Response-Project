## Project Motivation

This project analyses disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that calssifies disaster messages. It is a part of a Data Science Nanodegree program by Udacity. The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. The aim is to create a machine learning pipleine to categorize these events so that the messages cab be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classsification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
